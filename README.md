## Using Deeplearning convert `Speech` to `text`
## Domain Background 
- It one of my primary areas of focus , and Udacity is one reaseon that give me the idea to work in `speech recognation` , it also talk about 
`speech recognation` which is a cretical area we need to see it , mean we need to change signals of speech to words, this is really cretical , I decide to work 
in this area because of I need to get more in working with speech and deeplearning ( Rnn) with this project I decided to make speech more normalized to be text 
and try to generalize it for arabic and english but it seems not easy , but with what I learn from my Nano Degree , I have the way to get into this project 
from my work through 4 monthes with projects from titanic to Learn Quadcopter , learning about machine learning and deeplearning which allowed me to use it easy 
to work through `speech Recognation` Project

- I am not the first one who work with `Speech Recognation` you can see some applications in this  [link](https://www.capterra.com/speech-recognition-software/)
but this applications that deployed already and has there accuracy , in my work I will take researches as my Guide, you can see [here](https://www.ijcsmc.com/docs/papers/May2015/V4I5201599a61.pdf)
